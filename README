     Program ........ CaMM (CActi Message Management) Plugin for Cacti
     Purpose ........ View and manage syslog/snmptt messages
 
 
 *******************************************************************************/
 
 
 ----[ Purpose
 	Plugin, which allows you to view/delete/alert/mark/manage SNMPTT (snmp traps and infos) OR/AND SYSLOG messages stored in a database. 
     
 ----[ Installation
 	IMPORTANT: This plugin ONLY shows data from mysql. It does not accept traps/syslog messages itself.
 	Requirements:
 		- Cacti 0.8.7b/c/d
 		- Plugin Architecture v2.Ñ… for Cacti v0.8.7
 			For syslog component:
 				- Syslog-ng (dump data to mysql);
 			For snmptt component:
 				- NET-SNMP trapd
 				- SNMPTT from http://www.snmptt.org/
 	
 	1. Install just like any other plugin, just throw it in the plugin directory,
 	in a folder called camm.
 	For PIA 2.0 and higher go to :
 		1.1 Console->Plugin Management->Uninstalled tab->camm -> install
 		1.2 Console->Plugin Management->Installed tab->camm -> enable
 		1.3 Open camm tab to start autoupgrade process;
 		1.4 In camm tab open "setting" tab and enable components to use (snmptt, syslog);
 	
 	2. Configure SNMPTT Component (only if You need this component and enable it):
 		Info about installing and configure snmptt programm - http://www.snmptt.org/
 		After that change same setting in snmptt.ini:
 			mibs_environment = ALL
 			date_time_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
 			unknown_trap_log_enable = 1
 			statistics_interval = 300 # or 3000
 			db_translate_enterprise = 1
 			
 			mysql_dbi_enable = 1
 			mysql_dbi_table = plugin_camm_snmptt
 			mysql_dbi_table_unknown = plugin_camm_snmptt_unk
 			mysql_dbi_table_statistics = plugin_camm_snmptt_stat

			mysql_dbi_host = localhost 			# << CHANGE !
			mysql_dbi_port = 3306 				# << CHANGE !
			mysql_dbi_database = cacti			# << CHANGE !
			mysql_dbi_username = cactiuser		# << CHANGE !
			mysql_dbi_password = cactipassword	# << CHANGE !

			mysql_ping_on_insert = 1
			mysql_ping_interval = 300
			date_time_format_sql = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
			stat_time_format_sql = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S

	3. Configure SYSLOG Component (only if You need this component and enable it):
		1. Install syslog-ng ([HOWTO] Install Syslog-ng on Linux/Unix Cacti vers - http://forums.cacti.net/viewtopic.php?t=26040)
			Here may be 2 schemes of work
				a)One table - all incoming messages stored in one table (default "plugin_camm_syslog")
				b)Two tables - all incoming messages stored in temp table (default "plugin_camm_syslog_incoming"). On each run poller process all rules and after that copy messages to main table 
			You can choose it in settings tab of plugin and import necessary sql file from /camm/sql folder and use this table name in syslog-ng.conf;

			Change the following lines to the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file to the END of the file:

				source net {
					udp();
				};
				destination d_mysql {
				    pipe("/tmp/mysql.pipe"
				    template("INSERT INTO plugin_camm_syslog (host, sourceip, facility, priority, sys_date, message, status) VALUES ( '$HOST',  '$SOURCEIP', '$FACILITY', '$PRIORITY', '$YEAR-$MONTH-$DAY $HOUR:$MIN:$SEC', '$MSG', '0' );\n")
				    template-escape(yes)
				     );
				};

				log { source(net); destination(d_mysql); };
				log { source(s_sys); destination(d_mysql); };

		2. For rsyslog support add template to /etc/rsyslog.d/mysql.conf

			### Configuration file for rsyslog-mysql
			### Changes are preserved
			$ModLoad ommysql
			$template cacti_camm_syslog,"INSERT INTO plugin_camm_syslog (host, sourceip, facility, priority, sys_date, message, status) values ('%hostname:::lower%', '%fromhost-ip%','%syslogfacility-text%', '%syslogpriority-text%', '%timereported:::date-mysql%', '%msg%', '0')", SQL

 ----[ Future Changes




 ----[ Changelog


 	CAMM --- 1.5.0 ---2009-02-26
 		Change plugin name (from "snmptt" name).
 		For upgrade from snmptt you need:
 			1. Backup you snmptt data (mysql tables [plugin_snmptt],[plugin_snmptt_statistics],[plugin_snmptt_tree],[plugin_snmptt_unknown],[plugin_snmptt_alert],[plugin_snmptt_syslog])
 			2. Backup you main system data (mysql tables [settings],[plugin_db_changes],[plugin_hooks],[plugin_config],[plugin_realms])
 			3. Copy all files from camm archive to <cacti_path>/plugins/camm
 			4. Goto cacti "Plugin Management" and install camm plugin. Install process will rename all old snmptt tables, settings and uninstall snmptt plugin. All realm settings for all users will be saved and reapllyed.
 			5. Enable camm plugin and open it.
 			6.1. If you use snmptt data - It is necessary to change a file [snmptt.ini] and restart snmptt service
 				mysql_dbi_table = plugin_camm_snmptt
 				mysql_dbi_table_unknown = plugin_camm_snmptt_unk
 				mysql_dbi_table_statistics = plugin_camm_snmptt_stat
 			6.2. If you use syslog-ng - It is necessary to change a file [syslog-ng.conf] and restart syslog-ng service
 				destination d_mysql {
 			    pipe("/tmp/mysql.pipe"
 			    template("INSERT INTO plugin_camm_syslog (host, sourceip, facility, priority, sys_date, message, status) VALUES ( '$HOST',  '$SOURCEIP', '$FACILITY', '$PRIORITY', '$YEAR-$MONTH-$DAY $HOUR:$MIN:$SEC', '$MSG', '0' );\n")
 			    template-escape(yes)
 			     );
 			If all OK - you can safe delete snmptt plugin.
 		
 		Changes:
 		- Use "component-like" system. Now you can use camm plugin for syslog and snmptt OR syslog only OR snmptt only data. Config it in settings tab after installing plugin.
 		- Enable/Disable components without page reload;
 		- Don't use Iframe any more. Use real full ExtJS app (some speedup);
 		- Added syslog "pre table" schema. Use it when you use separate table for incoming messages and only poller runs - rows will be copied in main syslog table. [Syslog incoming table] settings.
 			Don't forget for change syslog-ng.conf. You can find sql for incoming table in camm/sql/plugin_camm_syslog_incoming_memory.sql. Import it in syslog DB;
 		
 		Minor updates:
 		- Some optimization code for callback;
 		- Show detailed error info for plugin's admin only;
 		- More detailed statistics;
 		- Stats graph's ID setting;
 
 		Known issue
 		- Don't work old snmptt stat graph's (the best will be delete it and create new later);

	CAMM --- 1.6.62 ---2010-07-02
	- Switch to use ExtJS 3.2.1.
	- Add parameter in camm settings [Hostname include domain]. Set it to [1] if in cacti You use FQDN in hostnames, but syslog sent only 'host' in messages;
	- The total change in the principles of search/mark messages by rules. Prior to that, if the message fell into 2 or more markering rules, it contained only a marker of the last rule. Now it is corrected by a new mechanism for marking. This should also positively affect the speed of processing. It also removes the restriction on the value of the marker. (previously it was <100). In order to process all records in the new scheme - follow these instructions after updating plugin "Truncate table plugin_camm_tree2;" and "update <you_syslog_db>.plugin_camm_syslog set `status`='0';". Warning - this may cause a large load during the next cycle of the poller.
	- Update Slate theme;
	- Added new field [add] in the message's table, which can be used for any purpose - for example, for additional information and processing user-defined functions;
	- Added new field in [rule] table - [actual_triggered] - stores information about the current number of messages that fall under this rule;
	- A small change in the appearance of the "Edit rule" window;
	Changes in the left menu:
		- hidden folder icon - just plus / minus - it saves additional space for description;
		- sorting menu made by db, which positively affects the speed of display / update the menu, especially whith large number of hosts (thousands);
		- added automatically calculate, readonly parameter [camm_use_group_by_host] responsible for the additional grouping of records. To avoid unnecessary stress is not desirable to have a base Cacti hosts with the same value hostname. Check it by this sql "SELECT  hostname, count(*)  FROM host group by hostname having count(*)>1"
	- Fix error in IE;
	- Fix PageSize of store if update by TreeMenu;
	- Fixed bug causing a show of all message when you use the menu for a certain period;

	CAMM --- 1.6.63 ---2010-07-05
	- Reduced the number of sql queries when opening the plugin from 9 to 4;
	- Fix error with sql edit field;
	
	CAMM --- 1.6.7 ---2010-08-26
	- Add Chart on stats tab. You can view the schedule of income during the selected messages from the selected interval and build the graph of the distribution of messages by hosts. Or you can go to view the specific messages.
	- Change to use rule_id as marker_id and rule_name as marker_name. Will no longer be confusion with the marker_id anr rule_id;
	
	- Fix old-time bug with autocreate of trees (thanks torstentfk);
